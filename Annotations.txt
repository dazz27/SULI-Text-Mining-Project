Crystals were obtained by equilibrating a reservoir solution containing 13% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1 M sodium chloride and 0.1 M Tris-hydroxyethyl aminomethane/HCl buffer at pH 8.0 against 8 µl of a 1:1 mixture of 30 mg/ml of MoFe protein and the reservoir solution under strictly anaerobic conditions.
Crystals were reduced by addition of 10 mM sodium dithionite to the cryo buffers.
2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD)
Purified iron protein was typically 20 to 30 mg ml-'
crystals were grown by a microcapillary batch method (23) by using a 2:1 ratio of precipitant (30 percent PEG 4000, 0.20 M Na2MoO4, 100 mM tris, pH 8.3) to protein at a concentration of 20 to 30 mg/ml in 50 mM tins, pH 8.0, 2 mM Na2S204, and 0.45 M NaCl.
Crystals were grown by the capillary microbatch method (16) with 20 íL of precipitant solution containing 26-29% PEG 4000, 700-900 mM NaCl, and 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 íL of protein solution containing 30 mg/mL all-ferrous Av2 in 20% glycerol, 450 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0).
Ti(III) citrate was removed from the Fe protein on a Sephadex G-25 column, and the protein was concentrated in a Centricon-30 apparatus in an anaerobic centrifuge to a final concentration of 30 mg/mL in 20% glycerol, 450 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0).
23% polyethylene glycol (MW 3350 g/mol, Hampton Research), 0.2 M lithium citrate (Aldrich), and 5 mM sodium dithionite (J.T. Baker).
Crude extracts were prepared by the osmotic shock method (22) in a degassed buffer that contained 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 1 mM sodium dithionite. For crude extract preparation, the buffer also contained 0.2 mM PMSF to inhibit protease activity. Prior to purification, the extracts were brought to 500 mM in NaCl by the addition of degassed, granular NaCl.
Cell extracts were loaded onto a Zn(II)-charged IMAC column (90 mL of resin in a 2.5 cm x 30 cm column) using a peristaltic pump. After loading the extract, the column as washed with three column volumes of Buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM sodium dithionite) containing 40 mM imidazole-HCl. The protein that remained bound to the column was then eluted using Buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole-HCl. The eluted protein was collected and diluted 8-fold in a degassed buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 1 mM sodium dithionite.
The diluted protein was then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (30 mL of resin in a 1.5 cm x 15 cm column) and eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (100-300 mM NaCl over 5 column volumes). Proteins eluted and were collected at approximately 250 mM NaCl.
All protein manipulations were performed under anaerobic conditions maintained using either a Schlenk apparatus (9) or an anaerobic glovebox.


C12E8 crystals were obtained using microbatch 96 Well IMP@CTTM 376 Plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). The dimeric C12E8 PSIIcc at 2 mM Chl. solubilized in buffer containing 0.02 M MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, 0.01 M CaCl2, 0.5 M Betaine and 0.013 % C12E8 (MCB) buffer was mixed in 1:1 ratio with the crystallization solution which contained 0.1 M TRIS/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4 (TN buffer) 14-18 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol 5000  monomethyl (PEG 5000 MME). Crystals grew at 20 °C and appeared after 2-3 day having a 382 size between 50-250 μm.
Wild-type ICH, the G150A, and the G150T mutants were crystallized by hanging drop vapor equilibration by mixing 2 μL of protein at 20 mg/ml and 2 μl of reservoir (23% PEG 3350, 100mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 200 mM magnesium chloride and 2 mM dithiotheritol (DTT)) and incubating at 22°C. Spontaneous crystals in space group P21 appear in 24-48 hours and were used to microseed other drops
1 μL of 200 mM sodium dithionite solution was added to every well to ensure complete removal of any dissolved oxygen. For each drop, 200 nL of well solution and 200 nL of 100 μM dimeric BchL (in 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) were mixed. A crystal was observed after approximately one month with the well
solution consisting of 0.6 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M MES:NaOH pH 6.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 4000. Larger volume (3-4 μL) drops of the same well solution and protein concentration in 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1 ratios of protein to well solution yielded large single crystals after ~2-3 months. Prior to freez-ing, the well solution was mixed in an equal volume of cryoprotectant solution with a final con-centration of 9% sucrose (w/v), 2% glucose (w/v), 8% glycerol (v/v), and 8% ethylene glycol (v/v).
